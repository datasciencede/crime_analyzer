# 🚔 Chicago Crime Data Analyzer -- EDA & Insights Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **Chicago crime data** to uncover patterns,
hotspots, and crime frequencies across regions and time. It uses data
cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques to provide
meaningful insights into crime trends in the city.

# 🔥 8 Key Head Points (With Explanations)

### **1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning**

-   Loads the Chicago crime dataset.
-   Fixes missing values, inconsistent crime labels, and converts
    date/time fields.
-   Ensures clean and reliable data for analysis.

### **2️⃣ Feature Engineering**

-   Generates new columns like Year, Month, Hour, and Weekday.
-   Helps identify when crimes happen most often.

### **3️⃣ Crime Type Analysis**

-   Identifies the most frequent crime types.
-   Uses bar charts and frequency tables for clear visualization.

### **4️⃣ Location-Based Insights**

-   Evaluates crime distribution by district, ward, and community areas.
-   Highlights major hotspots and high-risk neighborhoods.

### **5️⃣ Time-Series Crime Trends**

-   Analyzes crime patterns across years, months, and hours.
-   Reveals seasonal trends and high-activity time windows.

### **6️⃣ Arrest & Resolution Analysis**

-   Compares crimes with arrests vs. without arrests.
-   Shows differences across crime categories and locations.

### **7️⃣ Correlation & Statistical Exploration**

-   Examines relationships among variables like crime type, time, and
    arrest likelihood.
-   Supports deeper statistical understanding of crime behaviors.

### **8️⃣ Visualizations & Reporting**

-   Provides rich visuals including heatmaps, bar charts, line plots,
    crime maps, and scatter plots.
-   Delivers a visually clear summary of crime activity in Chicago.
